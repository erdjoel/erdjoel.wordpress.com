# Reading files
myFileObj = open(filename, 'w')
# other modifier:
# 'r' read-only (default mode, can be omitted)
# 	'r+' read and write. Doesn't create the file if not exist. Seek(0) will change the append behaviour to insert text where the index is set (instead of at the end)
#	'rb', 'r+b'
# 'a' append
#	'a+' read and append. Will also create the file if required. Seek(0) doesn't change the position where the text will be appended (always at the end).
#	'ab', 'a+b'
# 'w' read and write. will create the file if not exist.
#	'w+' open-clear all content-write. Use this if you always want to start with empty file
#	'wb', 'w+b'
# On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode, so there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb', and 'r+b'.
# Python on Windows makes a distinction between text and binary files; in text files the end-of-line characters are automatically altered slightly when data is read or written.
# This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for ASCII text files, but itâ€™ll corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files.
