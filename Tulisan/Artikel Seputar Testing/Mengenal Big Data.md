#Data Governance#

Big data governance requires three things:
1. automated integration: easy access to the datawherever it resides
2. visual content: easy categorization,indexing, and discovery within big data to optimize its usage
3. agile governance: the definition and execution of governance appropriate to the value of the data and its intended use.
 
Looking at these three things provides businesses with a quick way to profile the level of importance of the data and, therefore, the amount of security required to protect it.
